# Classic OS Synchronization Problems

This repository contains implementations of classic synchronization problems in operating systems.

## Problems
- **Producer–Consumer** – Coordination between producers adding data and consumers removing data from a shared buffer.  
- **Reader–Writer** – Managing concurrent access where multiple readers can read simultaneously but writers need exclusive access.  
- **Dining Philosophers** – Illustrating deadlock and synchronization issues when multiple processes compete for shared resources.

## Concepts
- Process synchronization  
- Critical section problem  
- Semaphores, mutexes, and monitors  

## Notes
Alongside the source code files, detailed explanations and sample outputs are provided in accompanying **PDF documents** for further study.
